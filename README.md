**LIFT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM APPLICATION :**
This application replicates the process of multiple lifts working in a lift which is maintainded to access all the floors with efficiency.
All the lifts were constrained to specifice floors ( in this code L1 and L2 from floor 0-5 and L3 and L4 from 0,6-10 ) And other lift are accessible to all the floors (L5 in this code).
We have to make the lift working is  such away that it utilise the lift nearby and save energy consimption and save time also.
