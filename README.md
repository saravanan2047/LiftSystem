### LIFT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM


## Overview

The Lift Management System is a console-based Java application designed to simulate the operations of an elevator system. This project leverages object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and data structures and algorithms (DSA) to create a robust and efficient system. The core functionality includes creating a lift view and managing the state and behavior of the lift.

## Features

- **Singleton Pattern:** The `LiftMain` class ensures that only one instance of the lift management system exists throughout the application.
- **Lift View Creation:** The `LiftView` class handles the graphical representation and user interactions related to the lift system.
- **Version Management:** The application maintains version information and the app name for easy identification and management.

## Concepts Used

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

1. **Encapsulation:** The `LiftMain` class encapsulates the properties and methods related to the lift management system. This ensures that the internal state of the object is hidden from the outside world and can only be accessed through a controlled interface.

2. **Singleton Pattern:** The singleton design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This is achieved using the `getInstance` method in the `LiftMain` class:
   ```java
   public static LiftMain getInstance() {
       if (liftmain == null) {
           liftmain = new LiftMain();
       }
       return liftmain;
   }
   ```

3. **Method Overriding and Inheritance:** While the provided code snippet does not explicitly show inheritance and method overriding, these are common OOP concepts that might be used in other parts of the project.

### Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

1. **Efficient State Management:** The singleton pattern helps in managing the state of the application efficiently by ensuring that state changes are consistent and managed through a single instance.
   
2. **Event Handling:** The `LiftView` class likely implements event handling mechanisms to manage user interactions, which is a key aspect of creating interactive applications.

## Usage

1. **Setup and Execution:**
   - Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
   - Compile the Java files using `javac`.
   - Run the application using `java`.

2. **Compilation:**
   ```bash
   javac LiftMain.java
   ```

3. **Execution:**
   ```bash
   java LiftMain
   ```

## Detailed Class Explanation

### LiftMain Class

- **Attributes:**
  - `private static LiftMain liftmain;` - Singleton instance of the class.
  - `private String appName = "Lift Management System";` - Name of the application.
  - `private String version = "0.0.1";` - Version of the application.

- **Methods:**
  - `public static LiftMain getInstance()` - Returns the singleton instance.
  - `public void create()` - Creates an instance of `LiftView` and initializes it.
  - `public String getAppName()` - Returns the application name.
  - `public String getVersion()` - Returns the application version.

### LiftView Class

The `LiftView` class is responsible for creating the lift's visual representation and handling user interactions. While the details are not provided in the snippet, it likely includes methods for initializing the view and handling user input events.

## Requirements

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure that JDK is installed on your system to compile and run the program.

## Conclusion

This Lift Management System project demonstrates the effective use of OOP principles and DSA techniques in building a console-based Java application. By leveraging encapsulation, the singleton pattern, and efficient state management, the project ensures a robust and maintainable codebase.
